  The <strong>Bitter</strong> app is a platform designed to bring forth transparency and unbiased opinions about anything and everything - from restaurants and movies, to jobs and personal experiences. 
  <br />
  <br />
  The platform leverages a simple, user-friendly interface, where users can easily sign in to post, edit, or delete their personal reviews. These reviews are based on a selection of 5 categories, ensuring diverse coverage of their experiences. 
  The application does not restrict access to only signed-in users; anyone visiting the platform can view all the reviews, thus promoting the sharing of genuine experiences and providing a comprehensive understanding of various topics.
  The aim is to provide a universal platform for users to express their opinions and for others to gain insights, whether they are making a choice or simply looking for honest reviews.

  <strong>Use Bitter. Feel Better.</strong>
